This code takes three arguments, the left delimiter, the right delimiter and the target text that is to be found within the two delimiters.
It opens a file named index.
It looks for the first pair of delimiters and selects the entire text between the two delimiters (that include the target). This selection is a path to a file.
This selection is then replaced with a URL. It gets the URL from another file named CDN.
The URL it selects depends on whether the target text in the original file has the word 'thumbs' in its path.


	so for example

The delimiters are the quote marks, 
the target text is:		DSC1288
the found chunk is:		./img/1-WarHero/2-_DSC1288.jpg

	When the code is run, this line in the file named 'index'
		<img src="./img/1-WarHero/2-_DSC1288.jpg">

	becomes this line in the file 
		<img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13722460/9616761/e845b116-50cd-11e5-8c33-b5e34e40beda.jpg">

	It gets the above URL from a file named CDN which has a bunch of lines of them looks like this:
	![2-_dsc1288](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13722460/9616761/e845b116-50cd-11e5-8c33-b5e34e40beda.jpg)


	another example:

The delimiters are the quote marks, 
the target text is:		DSC_0413
the found chunk is:		./img/1-WarHero/thumbs/21-DSC_0413.jpg

	in the file, index, the line:
		<img class="gallery-cell-image" data-flickity-lazyload="./img/1-WarHero/thumbs/21-DSC_0413.jpg" srcset="./img/1-WarHero/21-DSC_0413.jpg 3x, ./img/1-WarHero/thumbs/21-DSC_0413.jpg 1x"></div>

	becomes
		<img class="gallery-cell-image" data-flickity-lazyload="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13722460/9616793/21ed47da-50ce-11e5-956c-507391d8a719.jpg" srcset="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13722460/9616760/e8449736-50cd-11e5-913c-6f042486a687.jpg 3x, https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13722460/9616793/21ed47da-50ce-11e5-956c-507391d8a719.jpg 1x"></div>

	It gets the url from a file named thumbsCDN which has a bunch of lines that look like this
		![21-dsc_0413](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13722460/9616793/21ed47da-50ce-11e5-956c-507391d8a719.jpg)





Here is my pseudocode:

open the file named index
repeat the loop below till the end of the file
	look for the left delimiter, look for the right delimiter
	is the target in the found chunk?
	Yes: 
		is the word 'thumbs' in the found chunk?
			Yes: open the thumbCDN file
				look for the target
				expand to include entire url
				copy url into file replacing found chunk
			No: open the CDN file
				do the same three steps as above
	No:
		mpve on to the next left delimiter
